About The Company
Godrej and Boyce Manufacturing Company Limited (GBMCL), as per its credit rating report, is engaged in diverse business segments spanning home
appliances, FMCG, consumer products, industrial products (process plant and equipment), oleochemicals, security equipment, animal feed, real estate
development, and oil palm plantation through various group companies. The rationale for the restructuring was to enhance the company’s flexibility for any
future corporate action, such as an Initial Public Offering (IPO), public listing of an individual division, or a strategic partner coming on board. The company
operates in diverse business divisions, offering consumer, office, and industrial products and services across India and the globe. GBMCL's main production
facility is located in Mumbai (Vikroli), while its manufacturing units are at Shirwal and Shindewadi (near Pune, Maharashtra), Mohali (Punjab), Bhagwanpur
and Haridwar (Uttarakhand), Dahej (Gujarat), and Chennai (Tamil Nadu).
