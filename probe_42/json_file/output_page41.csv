About The Company,"Godrej and Boyce Manufacturing Company Limited (GBMCL), as per its credit rating report, is engaged in diverse business segments spanning home appliances, FMCG, consumer products, industrial products (process plant and equipment), oleochemicals, security equipment, animal feed, real estate development, and oil palm plantation through various group companies. The rationale for the restructuring was to enhance the companyâ€™s flexibility for any future corporate action, such as an Initial Public Offering (IPO), public listing of an individual division, or a strategic partner coming on board. The company operates in diverse business divisions, offering consumer, office, and industrial products and services across India and the globe. GBMCL's main production facility is located in Mumbai (Vikroli), while its manufacturing units are at Shirwal and Shindewadi (near Pune, Maharashtra), Mohali (Punjab), Bhagwanpur and Haridwar (Uttarakhand), Dahej (Gujarat), and Chennai (Tamil Nadu)."
